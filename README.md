Practice using Bootstrap by creating an image gallery

After taking a Web Development course from Udemy, I completed one of the projects to make this image gallery.
The original assignment called for different styling, so I made a few tweaks to how I wanted it to look.

The goal of the project was to understand how to use Bootstrap to successfully format a webpage using containers.
